# Process-Context Engine (PCE)

## 1. Concept (Including Theoretical Background)

The Process-Context Engine (PCE) is a theoretical framework designed to support complex cognitive processes and decision-making. At its foundation lie philosophical theories of cognition and social network theory. PCE models how individual cognitive processes dynamically generate meaning through their dependence on and mutual relationships with context, aiming to capture the process of meaning and knowledge generation in a dynamic and relational manner.

This theoretical framework goes beyond mere information processing models, characterized by its understanding of cognition as a context-dependent dynamic process. The generation of cognition and meaning is conceived not through fixed structures or static knowledge bases, but rather as continuously reconstructed through interactions among diverse processes and contextual variations. PCE thereby provides a new perspective for artificial intelligence and cognitive science, contributing to the understanding of cognitive phenomena as complex systems.

The design philosophy of PCE is heavily influenced by the symbolic-cognitive theory of philosopher Ernst Cassirer and Actor-Network Theory (ANT), which developed in the social sciences and artificial life domains. These theories provide perspectives that view cognitive and social phenomena not as mere collections of elements but as dynamic relationships and networks, forming the foundation for understanding the mutually generative relationship between "process" and "context" that underlies PCE.

Furthermore, PCE presents an approach that renews traditional semantics by capturing the generation of meaning not as the static assignment of meaning to symbols, but as functional relationships that continuously change according to context. This enables meaning and knowledge to be understood as products of generative and relational processes rather than fixed entities, making the dynamic adaptability and flexibility of cognition explicable.

### 1.1 Minimal Term Definitions

This section provides minimal definitions of fundamental terms to support theoretical understanding of PCE.

- **Process**: An independent computational unit that dynamically generates meaning through interaction with other processes and contexts.
- **Context**: A dynamic environment formed within the interaction among processes that facilitates the generation and transformation of meaning.
- **Meaning**: A functional relationship that continuously changes in context-dependent ways, not merely a fixed symbolic referent.
- **Relationality**: The interactions and network-like connections among processes and between processes and contexts.
- **Generation**: The process by which new distinctions, rules, and vocabularies emerge through interaction. Includes the oscillation between stabilization and variation.
- **Boundary**: A threshold that articulates and connects different contextual layers and symbolic systems. A site where translation and mediation occur, and a point where invariants (constraints to be preserved) become visible.

These terms constitute the foundational elements of PCE's theoretical framework and facilitate consistent understanding in subsequent discussions.

## 2. Philosophical Foundations (Integrative Perspective of Cassirer and ANT)

Ernst Cassirer conceived human cognition as "symbolic forms," considering that the meaning of the world is formed through diverse symbolic systems such as language, myth, and science. His symbolic-cognitive theory positions cognition not as passive information reception but as an active process of meaning generation. For Cassirer, symbols are not mere emblems but structural frameworks that mediate the relationship between world and subject, constituting the foundation of cognition. This perspective provides the basis for understanding the dynamic and generative nature of "context" and "meaning" in PCE.

Cassirer's thought clarified the multilayered structure of cognition through symbols, showing how language, culture, and scientific knowledge form human understanding of the world. He systematized cognition as a "philosophy of symbolic forms," analyzing the diverse functions and roles of symbols. Through this, cognition is grasped not as mere information processing but as a continuous process of meaning generation and transformation.

On the other hand, Actor-Network Theory (ANT), developed by Bruno Latour, Michel Callon, and others, is a social science theory that posits that social and material elements relate to each other as "actors," forming networks through which reality is constituted. ANT transcends fixed structures and subject-object dualism, focusing on the dynamic generation and transformation of relationality. Actors include not only humans but also materials, technologies, and institutions, and social phenomena are thought to arise from their complex entanglements.

The perspective of ANT provides important insights for understanding cognitive processes and contexts in PCE not as static entities but as networks generated through mutual connection. Cognition is understood not as a collection of individual processes but as a network of relationality and interaction among processes, whose generation and transformation are driven by the dynamic reorganization of relationality.

Thus, Cassirer's symbolic-cognitive theory and ANT's relational perspective form the philosophical foundation for meaning and context in PCE, providing a framework for understanding the generation of cognition and knowledge as dynamic and relational processes. The integration of both redefines cognition not as a mere internal process but as something generated through interaction with the external environment and social networks, supporting the theoretical depth of PCE.

### 2.1 Cassirer's "Substance Concept" and "Function Concept"

Cassirer conceived the epistemological turn of the modern era as a shift from **substance concept (Substanzbegriff)** to **function concept (Funktionsbegriff)**.

- **Substance Concept**: A framework that assumes things as a "substratum bearing attributes" and grasps them as collections of fixed properties. Congenial to classical schemas such as form/matter and subject/predicate.
- **Function Concept**: A framework that captures things not as fixed substrata but as **nodes of relation, structure, and operation**. Connects to mathematical functions, group-theoretic structures, and concepts of field and invariants in physics. Shifts focus from "what it is" to "how it relates, how it is transformed, and what invariances are preserved."

This turn provides the foundation for understanding meaning and cognition from the perspective of **relational networks** and **generative rules**. In Cassirer, "symbolic forms" are not substantial entities but modes of **functional (mapping) order**.

### 2.2 Mapping to PCE: From Substance to Function

PCE inherits this turn as follows:

- **Meaning = Function**: Meaning is given not as a fixed attribute but as a **mapping** `f(sign, context, process) → dispositions` (§3.1).
- **Context = Relational Network**: Context appears not as substratum but as a chain of interdependence and translation among processes (ANT-style network).
- **Stabilization = Provisional Substantialization**: Practical inscriptions, norms, and institutions provide temporary **substantive-appearing** stability, but this is merely **revocable fixation** created by relations (§4.2).
- **Invariants and Boundaries**: The **invariants** (distinctions, roles, constraints to be preserved) that are maintained even as relations change constitute the philosophical core of PCE's "boundary" concept.

Thus, PCE's position does not completely negate "substance." Substantive grasp is necessary as an **operational approximation**, while theoretically prioritizing **functional and relational** explanation. This corresponds to "form (manifest) = provisional substance / emptiness (latent) = relational constitution" (§2.5).

### 2.3 Tension and Bridging of Integration

Cassirer's symbolic-cognitive theory and ANT's relational perspective each have different philosophical backgrounds and methodologies, so a certain tension exists in their integration. While Cassirer focuses on the structural aspects of cognition, ANT attends to the dynamic generation of social and material networks. This tension brings theoretical richness and complexity in the development of the dynamic and relational cognitive model that PCE aims for.

PCE serves to bridge these theories, relating the internal generative process of symbolic forms with the external generative process of social networks, promoting multilayered and multifaceted understanding of cognition. This integration transcends traditional dualism in cognitive science and contributes to the construction of a more comprehensive cognitive model.

This document bridges the tension between both through the following **mediating concepts**:

- **Translation**: Operations that transfer meaning between different symbolic forms. Translation is not an incidental accompaniment but a condition of existence for forms.
- **Mediation**: Points of action where people, objects, institutions, and devices are involved and rewire relationships.
- **Inscription**: Sedimentation into traces, records, and standards. Stabilizing yet revocable, leaving room for re-inscription.

### 2.4 Implications from Post-Structuralism: Deconstruction

The post-structuralist perspective, particularly Jacques Derrida's deconstructive theory, provides important implications for PCE's dynamic understanding of meaning and context. Deconstruction dismantles the fixity of meaning, emphasizing that meaning is always generated within difference and deferral. This thought resonates with the functional and dynamic nature of meaning in PCE, theoretically supporting the polysemy and ambiguity of meaning.

The deconstructive perspective provides critical and deepening analysis of the variability of context and the reconstructive process of meaning that PCE handles, strengthening the philosophical foundation for enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of cognitive models. While acknowledging undecidability, in practice it is **resolved through success condition bundles** (§5.2).

### 2.5 Dependent Origination and "Emptiness"—A Reading of Form is Emptiness, Emptiness is Form (PCE Supplement)

The grasp of "meaning = function" and "context = field of generation" stated earlier in this document is compatible with Buddhist **dependent origination** (mutually dependent generation) and **emptiness** (denial of self-nature). Here, "emptiness" is not synonymous with **nothingness** or negation but indicates **absence of self-standing substantiality = constitution through relation**.
From this viewpoint, "**form is emptiness, emptiness is form**" can be organized as follows in accordance with PCE.

- **Form (kata) = Manifest interpretation, rules, inscription**: Composition visible as actors/artifacts/institutions/symbols.
- **Emptiness (kara) = Non-self-natured potentiality**: The fact that these are established only in dependence on **relational and contextual networks**.
- **Emptiness is form**: Relation-dependent potentiality (emptiness) arises into **manifestation (form)** through boundary, translation, and trace.
- **Form is emptiness**: Manifestation (form) is not fixed substance but a revocable composition always **re-mappable** through relation.

#### Latent Context Pool and "Emptiness"

The **latent context pool** assumed by PCE is a **reservoir of relational possibilities prior to concrete interpretation**. Individual elements have no "self-nature" and **manifest as signifiers (form)** each time through **boundary, translation, and relational update**. Therefore, the content managed by the pool is not a substantial stock but **emptiness as relation**. This is not nihilism. Rather, it is the name for **generative potential (potentiality)**.

#### Consistency with Cassirer / ANT / Derrida

- **Cassirer**: Symbolic forms do not self-subsist. They manifest only upon **context = inter-formal relation**, sharing "emptiness."
- **ANT**: Actors are not self-standing substances but are constituted by their **degree of connection to networks**. Logic of self-nature denial = relational constitution.
- **Derrida** (différance): Meaning arises as **deferral of difference**, and manifestation always carries dependence on trace-groups. A reading of "within form there is emptiness."

#### Philosophical Implications in PCE (At the Level of Operational Principles)

1) **De-substantialization**: Treating meanings, rules, and principles not as fixed objects but as **revocable in relation to relational rearrangement**.
2) **Visualization**: Making translation paths, traces (inscription), and boundaries **legible in readable form**.
3) **Acceptance of Ambivalence**: Presupposing the **oscillation** of emptiness = latent / form = manifest, not opposing stabilization and variation.
4) **Awareness of Pathology**: Attention to the polar pathologies of **dogmatization** (self-nature-ization) of form and **excessive fluidity** (indefinitization) of emptiness.

*Note: The terms "signifier/signified" here are used for convenience in the Saussurean distinction; in PCE, "signifier = manifestation of relation (form)" and "signified = not a fixed substance but an effect generated by re-mapping of relation."*

*Remark*: "Emptiness" here is not an assertion of religious belief but a metaphor—quasi-concept—as **relational ontology**. The purpose of PCE is to achieve both visualization of emptiness = latency and revocable operation (criticizability) of form = manifestation.

## 3. Meaning and Context (Transition from Sign to Function)

In PCE, "meaning" and "context" are grasped not as fixed attributes or mere accumulations of information but as functional relationships generated through interaction among processes. Symbols are not merely symbolic representations but play a dynamic role in determining the behavior of processes as meaning changes according to context.

This transition means understanding meaning not as a static "thing" but as a context-dependently changing "function." The functional understanding here refers to meaning functioning not as having a single fixed referent but as a dynamic rule or mapping that changes according to context and the states of other processes, determining behavior. This perspective transcends traditional frameworks of semantics and semiotics, positioning the generation of meaning within the relationality of processes.

PCE positions context not as mere background information but as an active force that prompts the generation and transformation of processes. Context continually changes within the interaction among processes and functions as a dynamic field that facilitates the reconstruction of meaning. For example, the meaning generated by a certain cognitive process depends on the context at that time, and that context itself is transformed by the outputs of other processes. In this way, meaning and context are mutually dependent and understood as generated in a chain-like and circular manner.

This functional transition makes the flexibility and adaptability of meaning explicable, capturing the dynamic characteristics of cognition in complex and changing environments. Furthermore, this approach accepts the polysemy and ambiguity of meaning as natural, opening possibilities for rich meaning generation beyond fixed meaning assignment.

### 3.1 Semi-Formalization of Definition (Distinction between functional and functionalist)

"Functional" in this document refers to **mapping**, distinguished from "functionalist" (functionalism/teleological).

**Definition (Unified Version)**:
`meaning(s) := f(s, C, P) → D`
where *s* is a sign, *C* is contextual state, *P* is process, and *D* is a bundle of observable changes (e.g., preference updates, inference threshold changes, re-inscription policies toward other signs).

### 3.2 Hierarchical Contexts and Time Scales

Context is not confined to a single level but exists at multiple hierarchical levels and varies at different time scales. For example, individual cognitive context, social context, and cultural context are positioned at different hierarchies and mutually influence each other. PCE dynamically integrates these multilayered contexts, supporting the adaptability of cognitive processes. **Boundary objects (Star & Griesemer)** function as mediators for collaboration across layers.

## 4. Process and Relationality (Principles of Generative Interaction)

The central component of PCE, "process," behaves generatively within relationships with other processes and contexts while being an independent computational unit. These processes are not mere data processing but dynamic fields of interaction that mutually influence each other, creating new meaning and context.

This interaction is based not on simple causal relationships but on complex network-like generative principles. Relationality among processes is not fixed but continues to change, characterized by a circular generative process in which each process's output forms the context of other processes, and that context further transforms the process's behavior. Such generative interaction includes non-linearity, feedback loops, and multilayered network structures, reflecting the complexity of cognitive and social phenomena.

For example, a certain cognitive process forms a specific context, that context regulates the interpretation and behavior of another process, and that result reconstructs the context of the first process—such circular relationships arise. Such interaction goes beyond mere information transmission or command passing, functioning as an active force that facilitates the generation of meaning and context.

These principles of generative interaction are core concepts when PCE models cognition and decision-making as complex systems, providing important implications for understanding human cognition, social interaction, and the dynamic adaptation mechanisms of artificial intelligence. Especially as a theoretical foundation explaining the flexibility of cognition, emergent behavior, and environmental adaptability, PCE has the potential to transcend conventional static models.

### 4.1 Pathology of Generation

In the process of generative interaction, instability and confusion sometimes arise. This is termed "pathology of generation," pointing to the possibility that excessive feedback or unbalanced relationality among processes can cause confusion in cognition and meaning. PCE also envisions understanding and controlling such pathological states.

**Examples of Triggering Conditions**:

- **Translation Monopolization**: When a specific actor monopolizes translation paths and refutation or alternative paths are blocked.
- **Trace Invisibilization**: When inscription becomes a closed system and origin and modification history become untraceable.
- **Under/Over-Constraint**: When invariants are too loose, causing drift, or too rigid, causing dogmatization.

### 4.2 Stabilization and Inscription

Within generative interaction, certain stabilization occurs, and temporary fixation of context and meaning arises. This is termed "inscription," an important process supporting the persistence and shareability of cognition. PCE theoretically positions the mechanism for dynamically adjusting the balance between stabilization and change. Inscription is **revocable** and can be re-inscribed in response to error or contextual change.

## 5. Significance of PCE (Implications for Human, AI, and Social Contexts)

PCE theoretically captures the complexity of human cognitive processes and social meaning generation, providing a new perspective for artificial intelligence and cognitive science. In particular, by handling meaning and context dynamically and relationally, it shows the possibility for AI systems to behave self-generatively while flexibly adapting to environments and social situations, going beyond mere information processing.

In this respect, PCE overcomes the limitations of static, hierarchical knowledge representation that conventional AI models face, reconstructing the processes of learning and inference as context-dependent and generative processes. This enables AI to self-organizationally reinterpret meaning and achieve adaptive behavior in response to changing environments and diverse user intentions.

Furthermore, PCE is also useful as a framework for understanding the generation and transformation of meaning in social contexts, providing a theoretical foundation for capturing the dynamic aspects of knowledge sharing and communication. By modeling how meaning is formed, transformed, and propagated within social networks and cultural contexts, development as a foundational technology supporting richer meaning understanding and adaptive behavior in a future society where humans and AI coexist and collaborate is anticipated.

Moreover, PCE's theory is applicable to diverse fields such as education, healthcare, management, and policy-making, offering new methodologies for supporting complex decision-making and knowledge creation processes. System design based on the dynamic and relational nature of cognition has the potential to approach the essence of human creativity and social interaction.

In this way, PCE, as a framework combining philosophical and theoretical depth with practical applicability, is expected to contribute to the future development of cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and social sciences.

### 5.1 Positioning of the Theory

Compared to existing cognitive theories and AI models, PCE has uniqueness in its focus on dynamic relationality and generative processes. Its positioning is on the extension of complex systems science and relationalist philosophy, evaluated as an attempt to overcome the limitations of conventional static and hierarchical models.

### 5.2 Success Condition Bundle

The theoretical success of PCE is achieved when the following conditions are met:

- Dynamic context change modeling is realistic and flexible
- Functional understanding of meaning is applicable to actual cognitive processes
- The theory of generative interaction contributes to explaining cognitive and social phenomena
- **Revocability**: Inscription can be re-inscribed, retracted and revised in response to error or contextual change.
- **Traceability**: Traces and translation paths can be followed.
- **Replicability**: Similar interpretations and behavioral tendencies are reproduced in different readers and settings.

These conditions serve as important indicators in the empirical verification and application of the theory.

### 5.3 Short Thought Experiment

To deepen understanding of PCE, the following thought experiment is proposed:

- Imagine an AI agent adapting to different social contexts and reconstructing meaning, and track that dynamic change.
- Try modeling how human cognitive processes flexibly respond to contextual variation within PCE's framework.

**Thought Experiment: API Specification Reversal**
Read the same API specification document in three contexts: (i) development team design meeting, (ii) legal review, (iii) end-user notification. Evaluate `meaning(s)` for each context C_i and observe the differences in preferences, thresholds, and re-inscription policies D_i. Next, increase or decrease just one Boundary (invariant) and track how D_i changes.
